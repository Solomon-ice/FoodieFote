- Background color: Soft Linen (#F4F2E8) is desaturated, yet complements the primary, providing a comforting backdrop.
- Accent color: Warm Apricot (#F2BE5C) brings energy, and contrasts well for call-to-action buttons and interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Alegreya', a serif typeface which gives a vintage literary feel
- Utilize minimalist, outlined icons for a modern, clean interface. Icons will represent different food categories and common cooking actions (upload, search, save).
- Implement a responsive, card-based layout for the recipe display to ensure usability across various devices. Prioritize clean lines and whitespace for readability.
- Use subtle animations, like a fade-in effect when new recipes are generated, to provide a polished user experience. Avoid excessive animations that might distract the user.
